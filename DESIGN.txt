Author: Robert Steilberg | rhs16
Genre: Role-playing game / turn-based strategy

Pokemon Duke Blue is the newest release to the Pokemon video game franchise.
You begin as a lowly freshman, armed only with your trusty Charizard
as you try to battle your way to the Pokemon championship. Your goal:
become the Pokemon master of Duke University by catching 'em all and defeating any
enemies that stand in your path. Only after defeating a most formidable opponent
will you finally be able to claim the title of Duke University's Pokemon Master!

Controls:
	Up/down/right/left arrow keys: move your sprite throughout the map, or
	choose which moves you'll use in battle
	Z: equivalent to the "A" button on a GameBoy (affirmative/attack command)
	
Goal:
	Defeat all your enemies using your battling skills and become Duke University's
	Pokemon master! You'll do this by getting tips from fellow students and ultimately
	challenging the reigning Pokemon master.
	
General world mode:
	You navigate through Duke University's East Campus, interacting with dorm leaders
	and working your way up to Baldwin Auditorium, which will be the scene of your
	ultimate battle. Press Z to talk to an NPC. You will ultimately challenge Duke's
	incumbent Pokemon master--COACH K!
	
Battle mode:
	Each opponent begins with a set amount of HP according to their Pokemon's strength.
	Pressing the Z key repeatedly deals damage to your opponent's Pokemon, but wait too
	long, and your opponent will defeat you first. Attacks are dealt to your Pokemon
	on a timely basis. Your Pokemon's HP will decline as your opponent's Pokemon attacks,
	so you must attack your opponent's Pokemon as quickly as possible to prevent that from
	happening.
